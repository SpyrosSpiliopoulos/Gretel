### instructions

** if you have anaconda then:
conda create --name Gretel
conda activate Gretel

** else:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. you should make chrome available to your environment through the PATH variable (try chrome from the console to check)


### python cookie_trackme.py opens up a chrome incognito session

1. you look around the website (probably change privacy settings)
2. the console asks you whether you want to fetch cookies 
3. you give a name to your cookie profile

visualization takes place once you are done (no more cookies, no other website to add)
